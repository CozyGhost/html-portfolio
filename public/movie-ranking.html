<h1>Some Neat Movies</h1>
<h2>By Genre</h2>

<hr />
    <h3>Sci-fi</h3>
        <h4>Blade Runner</h4>
            <p>An essential movie for everyone to see. It's beautifully shot and
            unlike any other film.</p>
        <h4>The Matrix</h4>
            <p>Another movie unlike any other. Its commentary on society is invaluable.</p>
<hr />
    <h3>Action</h3>
        <h4>Demolition Man</h4>
            <p>Don't you know about the three seashells?</p>
        <h4>The Book of Eli</h4>
            <p>The twist at the end is my favourite part, and it's generally just a fun, 
            corny, post-apocalyptic jaunt.</p>
<hr />
    <h3>Studio Ghibli</h3>
        <h4>Spirited Away</h4>
            <p>It's hard to describe the beauty of this film. The creatures Miyazaki introduces are unique
            and fun, even when things get dark.</p>
        <h4>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</h4>
            <p>3 Reasons:<br />
                <li>Oms are cool.</li>
                <li>Fungus is neat.</li>
                <li>Nausicaa is best.</li>
            </p>
